                    <p>Try to eat at least one piece of fruit a day. The scientists will study the variety of trees and 
                    observe which are fruiting. The team have really worked hard and are enjoying the fruits
                     of that labour.
                     The findings are the fruit of more than three years' research.Fruit is the sweet, fleshy,
                      edible part of a plant. It generally contains seeds. Fruits are usually eaten raw, although 
                      some varieties can be cooked.
                      They come in a wide variety of colours, shapes and flavours.
                      It is very good for health. You might also like.
